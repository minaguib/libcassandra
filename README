== End-Of-Life Notice

The libcassandra and libcassie libraries were written for the 0.X,1.1.X versions of cassandra,
using the thrift protocol.  Even then, they were minimal libraries not covering all of the
servers' offerings nor functionalities a modern client is expected to have.

Since then, Cassandra has also matured through several major releases, including a table-like
schema definition, CQL query language, and a more efficient binary protocol.  Datastax has
also significantly invested in stable client libraries for major languages.

At this time, for any new project, it's highly recommended you run the latest cassandra stable
release, and in C/C++, use this client driver provided by Datastax:

    CPP-DRIVER
    http://datastax.github.io/cpp-driver/

== libcassandra

A C++ wrapper library for the interface to cassandra generated by thrift. This library is based on
the Java client hector.

The master branch will follow along with Cassandra trunk. Branches corresponding to stable releases
of Cassandra will be available. Downloads of these branches are also provided.

The current master and 0.7.0 branches will work with Apache Cassandra 0.7.x. .  Internal libgenthrift
generated by thrift 0.6.0

== libcassie

A C wrapper library for the interface to cassandra generated by libcassandra.

== Install

$ ./config/autorun.sh
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install

== Running unit tests

If Google's C++ unit test framework, gtest, is installed on your machine, the unit tests can be run.

$ make check

The unit tests require a cassandra server with the default out of the box storage-conf.xml file to be running.

== Compiling C++ apps with libcassandra

$ g++ file.cc -lcassandra -lthrift -I/usr/local/include/thrift

Obviously, you should modify the line for your include to be where your thrift headers are
installed.

== Compiling C apps with libcassie

$ gcc file.c -lcassie
